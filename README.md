# Credit-Card-Fraud-Prediction-Model

## Introduction
The Credit Card Fraud Prediction dataset offers a variety of attributes valuable for comprehensive analysis. It contains 555,719 instances and 22 attributes, a mix of categorical and numerical data types. Importantly, the dataset is complete with no null values. I got this data from Kelvin Kelue on Kaggle, I'm using it for a project in which I'm building a Machine Learning model to detect credit card fraud.
